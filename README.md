## Development

## HTML naming conventions

Every component has an HTML element with a class assigned to it.

The naming of the class follows this rule : 

> **Path of the component to kebab case**

Ex : 
  - `<TpkInput>` : .tpk-input
  - `<TpkInput::Label>` : .tpk-input-label
  - `<TpkInput::Input>` : .tpk-input-input
